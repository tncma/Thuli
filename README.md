Thuli
=====

We think of Thuli as an *issue tracker* for the Government! A thuli, however, is not just a complaint. It could even be a proposal or simply an idea. By having a transparent communication channel between the government and the people & by providing incentives through the platform to sustain user interest, we believe we can take citizen engagement to new levels.

Thuli comprises of two components right now:
  - A web app (for both government officials and citizens)
  - An Android mobile app (for citizens for anytime anywhere access)

Other *WIP features* include:
  - Points, Leaderboard & Offers (to incentivize citizens & sustain their interest)
  - Allows citizens to take ownership of *Thulis* themselves. Allows organizations to place micro-bids.
  - Allows posting anonymously and for officials and the poster to have a private comment stream.
  - Allows officials to configure rules around managing Thulis & adding more custom attributes to individual thulis as their need may be (eg. Ward)

*Wishlist*:
  - Geotagging the posted *Thuli* automatically by the user's location (when using the mobile app)
  - Push notifications for every change of state of a *Thuli* to all stakeholders (poster, people who voted up, government officials)
  - Delegated authentication using the e-version of Aadar ID, maybe
  - Analytics:
    - Average *Thuli* resolution time
    - Leaderboard among municipalities on different parameters: Resolution time, First response time to a *Thuli* with sufficient vote ups.
