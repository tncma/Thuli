Thuli
=====

We think of Thuli as an *issue tracker* for the Government! A thuli, however, is not just a complaint. It could even be a proposal or simply an idea. By having a transparent communication channel between the government and the people & by providing incentives through the platform to sustain user interest, we believe we can take citizen engagement to new levels.

Thuli comprises of two components right now:
  - A web app (for both government officials and citizens)
  - An Android mobile app (for citizens for anytime anywhere access)

Other features include:
  - Points, Leaderboard & Offers (to incentivize citizens & sustain their interest)
  - Allowing citizens to take ownership of *Thulis* themselves. Allowing organizations to place micro-bids.
  - Allows posting anonymously and for officials and the poster to have a private comment stream.
